# Heart Disease Predictor

This project aims to build a machine learning-based system to detect the risk of heart disease in individuals based on clinical and lifestyle features. The system leverages supervised learning algorithms and presents predictions through a user-friendly web interface built with Django.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection is crucial to improve patient outcomes. This project implements machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

The system uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset and applies two machine learning models: *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* and *Random Forest Classifier*.
